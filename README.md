# Url Shortener
This application allows you to make URLs shorter  
This is my first project that I did during my programming learning

## Technology Stack
**Backend**:    ASP.NET Core  
**Frontend**:   HTML, CSS, JS  
**Database**:   PostgreSQL  
**Cache**:      Redis  
**Web Server**: Nginx  
**Containers**: Docker  

## Running application using Docker
First of all, you must have Docker and Docker Compose installed
You can run the application using Docker using this command:
```
bash app_run.sh
```
This script builds the backend image if it doesn't exist and starts all services

## Special Thanks
